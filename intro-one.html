    <ul>
    <li>Typing - Writing text on computer by pressing keys on keyboard is called typing.</li>
    <li>Touch Typing - Touch Typing is typing of next level. In touch typing process, typing experts type without looking at keyboard. All the key positions are stored in subconcious mind of user. By learning touch typing, users can type even faster than writing using paper pen.</li>
    <li>How to Learn Touch Typing - Once you start practicing on keyboard in a right way, your subconcious mind prepare itself, and with time you will learn it. Remember: Practice is secret in touch typing same as learning music.</li>
    <li>How much time? - It totally depends on you, a user can easily learn touch typing within 3 months by practicing 2-3 hours in a day.</li>
    <li>Typing Speed - 25 to 35WPM (words per minute) is highest speed for typing, but in touch typing experienced users can type 50-80 WPM. Advanced users type 80-150 WPM in there native language.</li>
    <li>How to learn? - where there is will there is a way. research on internet or follow tutorials of TypingCert and practice according to tutorials. Good Luck.</li>
    <li>Enjoy of Touch Typing? - If i share my experiance, i enjoy typing like music. I enjoy when i can type as fast as singing songs. When you type without looking at keyboard, it really make you feel nice.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p id="intro-topic">Language & fonts</p>
  <p id="intro-text">
    Computers support not only English. Once you learn typing is English, you can easily learn in other languages also. Fonts are differnt shapes of differnt characters for differnt languages, but i always suggest to learn UTF fonts only. you don't need to install UTF fonts from elsewhere, you need to enable specific language input from control panel. Still we have not any tutorials related to other language. In future, we will update our site.
  </p>
  <p id="intro-topic">Keyboard Layouts</p>
  <p id="intro-text">You have seen many times, characters in keyboard are not in sequence like a,b,c,d and e. This is because of we use QWERTY keyboard layout. there are many keyboard layouts like QWERTY, DVORAK, Colemak etc. We commnly use QWERTY Layout. It has q,w,e,r,t and y characters on the top row. Basic(2) Lesson explain this layout in detail.</p>
  <p id="intro-topic">Sitting Position</p>
  <p id="intro-text">Sitting position is first important step in learning typing. If you sit in wrong way, you may have pain in shoulders. If you work on computer in dark, it affect your eyes. Please make sure to sit in a manner and proper way. you should use a chair to sit, and a table to keep keyboard in front of you. your back should be straight. Keep your fingers on keyboard as described in Basic(2) Lesson. Mostly all keyboards have two sticks on backside that help to increase height of your keyboard.</p>
  <p id="intro-topic">Some Tips</p>
  <p id="intro-text">
    <ol>
      <li>Practice typing in beginning is difficult & Boaring, but after some practice you will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>You can use speakers while typing. TypingCert produce sound when you right word, and a different sound on pressing wrong word. This way, your ears also pass signal to your subconcious brain, when you type wrong. Also typing correct words give you feeling of a tune.</li>
      <li>Never do the mistake of pressing key with wrong finger. Explained in Basic(2)</li>
      <li>Once you start typing 25-30 WPM, Play a low beat song and try to write it in a text-editor. Practice it daily make you feel enjoy.</li>
      <li>In starting desktop keyboard is recommended instead of laptop. But it doesn't too affect your speed. you can use any keyboard.</li>
      <li>Practicing 2-4 Hours in day is enought, but be consistant.</li>
      <li>you can play typing games.</li>
    </ol>
